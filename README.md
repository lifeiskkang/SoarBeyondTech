# SoarBeyondTech

**SoarBeyondTech** is my personal journey of breaking limits, rising beyond doubts, and building the kind of technical strength that carries me further than I ever imagined.  

**(lifeiskkang — my way of saying that I live with grit, resilience, and the quiet fire to keep moving forward.)**

## Tech & Skills I’ll Be Exploring

- **AWS Cloud** (EC2, IAM, S3, VPC, Lambda, CloudFormation, etc.)  
- **DevOps & Infrastructure** (Linux, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, CI/CD)  
- **Python** (automation, scripts, small projects, cloud tooling)  
- **Engineering Mindset** — improvement, reflection, and sharp problem-solving

## A Small Promise to Myself
