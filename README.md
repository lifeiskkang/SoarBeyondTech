# 🌟 SoarBeyondTech

**SoarBeyondTech** is my personal journey of breaking limits, rising beyond doubts, and building the kind of technical strength that carries me further than I ever imagined.  
Every step here is a reminder that growth is built through persistence, courage, and the quiet fire to keep moving forward.  

**(lifeiskkang — my way of saying that I live with grit, resilience, and a fire that refuses to die.)**

## 🛠️ Tech & Skills I’ll Be Exploring
- **AWS Cloud** (EC2, IAM, S3, VPC, Lambda, CloudFormation, etc.)  
- **DevOps & Infrastructure** (Linux, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, CI/CD)  
- **Python** (automation, scripts, small projects, cloud tooling)  
- **Engineering Mindset** — improvement, reflection, and sharp problem-solving

## 📘 Why I Built This Repository
To create a space that reflects:
- my growth  
- my discipline  
- and the story of someone who keeps rising **beyond tech**  

This is more than a study repository.  
It’s a record of becoming someone stronger than yesterday.
